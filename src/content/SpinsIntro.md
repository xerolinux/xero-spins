# What are Spins ?
<br />
Spins are alternate versions of XeroLinux, using other Desktop Environments, for those not into KDE but enjoy my tweaks, they are created & optimized for your consumption. But unlike the Flagship, they will not change or be modified beyond updating the packages underneath keeping them as stable as possible. Also, they will receive limited support from me, at least. Worry not though, the <span>XeroLinux</span> community will be there to help where & when they can.
<br /><br />
The ISOs are no longer available on a donate for access model. So, the only way to get them now, is to build them yourselves, for free of course, following the easy-to-follow guide on <span>Github</span>, pulling latest packages in, that way you always have the latest version available as of build time. However, we still need your help & support to keep project alive, scroll down for more info...
