### What are Spins ?
<br />
Spins are alternate versions of XeroLinux, using other Desktop Environments, for those not into KDE but enjoy my tweaks, they are created & optimized for your consumption. But unlike the Flagship, they will not change or be modified beyond updating the packages underneath keeping them as stable as possible. Also, they will receive limited support from me, at least. Worry not though, the <span>XeroLinux</span> community will be there to help where & when they can.

### Availability/How To get them
<br />
New ISOs are available again ! Click the "Get ISO" button, once you Donate on <span>Ko-Fi</span> any amount you will receive Download links via e-mail reply, enjoy ! But alas building them yourselves for free is currently on hold, until our new build tool is finalized, since we are no longer affiliated with the current <span>ABS</span> build tool, which should also be done soon, so do not worry too much.
