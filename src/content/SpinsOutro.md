# Support XeroLinux + ISOs :
<br />
Well, the current situation, in <span>Lebanon</span>, is not great, with up to 4 hours of Government provided electricity, and 98% currency devaluation, among many other problems, I am limited on time & reources, and with no other means of income to keep the Generator power running for longer than absolutely necessary and cover server fees for hosting the sites and repos, therefore I solely rely on your generous contributions.
<br /> <br />
Below are the 2 extra ways you can suport me. <span>Patreon</span> will get you the ISOs as <span>Ko-Fi</span> above, but <span>Github</span> will not it's just a simple one-time/monthly donation. Choose carefully now y'hear ?
