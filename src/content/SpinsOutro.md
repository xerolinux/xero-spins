# XeroLinux could use your help :
<br />
Well, the current situation, in <span>Lebanon</span>, is not great, with up to 4 hours of Government provided electricity, and 98% currency devaluation, among many other problems, I am limited on time & reources, and with no other means of income to keep the Generator power running for longer than absolutely necessary and cover server fees for hosting the sites and repos, therefore I solely rely on your generous contributions. Any amount will go a long way making sure the project continues to thrive.
